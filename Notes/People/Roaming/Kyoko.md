Looks to be about 16. Long black hair covers 3 sides.

Works at [[Izakaya|The Terminus]] during the summer holidays.

At night, left the [[Izakaya]] and went into the [[Igarashi Mansion]]. In about 15 minutes, left, holding a small thing in her hand. Then, went back into the Izakaya. Did not seem to be suspicious of anything.

Has a metal plate with engraved Latin text -- this is a "neurocalibrator", a neural implant used to manage non-surgical mental diseases. These are stigmatized in society.

Tends to the [[Shrine]] in place of [[Igarashi-san]], who can't anymore.
Igarashi-san said that she doesn't have any friends her age.
