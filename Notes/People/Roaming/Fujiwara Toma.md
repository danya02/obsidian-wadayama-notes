Is a stereotypical "nerd", even if we do not refer to people like that: when saw him on `Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop`: thin, clumsily moves, light-blue kimono with dragonfly pattern and boots, he holds an old e-reader of 14 inches;

Fan of [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]].
On Session 11, conveyed [[Kotobuke Hana]]'s contact.
