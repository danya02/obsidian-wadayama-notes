The name is Nobuske and the surname is Kitagawa.

Landlord of our [[Apartment]]. Seems suspicious of everything.

Looks 65 years old, might be about 50.

Does not like Mike's name.

Knows me as Haruto.

Arrived in Wadayama from [[Kyoto]]. Neighbors do not like him and somebody wants to attack him. Says this confidently, but hides nervousness.

Showed us [[Nobuske's Threat]].
Gave us [[Nobuske's Quest]].

Asked about why there are many foreigners. Said that some live nearby (in the [[Chinese house|Chinese house]]?), and are quiet like mice "like they should be". Also [[Bikers]] occasionally drive, and the police don't care (but there are only two officers so maybe they're scared). Said we shouldn't care about this and there are more important things.

Asked about leads. Told him we were at school and supermarket. He told us about the Izakaya, could not remember the name. On evenings, the locals come there, a place of intrigue, fights and conflicts. Don't know who you can find there now but there are many people there in the evening.

After [[Knife Assault]], talked about [[Neurocalibrator]]. He does not care much about them.
Believes that they make people more crazy.
Offered the idea that someone is hacking people's neural implants to zombify them. ==To the best of our knowledge, this is false.==

[[Utsuji Hidehisa]] says he believes Nobuske is not who he claims to be.
His medical records are all technically valid, but they seem to have inconsistencies; feels like they have been gathered in parts from other people.

Offered to take part in the [[Festival]], but refused because he won't bend to them. But offered to scout out the festival to see anyone interesting. We will stay next to him and prevent people from approaching him.

On Session 10, [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visits him. Asks for updates, receive none.
Tell that we know someone has advanced hacking. Ask if smartglasses have behaved erratically.
Started saying technobabble as way to scare him. But he starts questioning, and we slip up, so he doesn't completely buy it.
Said that maybe our smartglasses spy on us, so shouldn't say much.
He turns his off, and suggests we go into the forest to talk about this.

While they're off, [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] investigates his house. Lockpicks his door.
Is an old-fashioned flat. Notices that closet contains clothes in nondistinct neotraditional style, plus some sets that are much finer than regular, and brand-name. Does not have dust on it. Has turned off and locked laptop. No items regarding work or hobby. Laptop is plugged in but turned off. Turning on gives password prompt.

Noticing that he is definitely from Okinawa: patterns on clothes, plates and wooden statues of two lions.

Over the bridge to [[Mt Hakkai Road]] moves scarf onto face and quietly asks to continue talking. Mike moves him forward to shrine. Tells him that one of us got hacked, and that it's by someone who likes [[Shrine]]. Say that people at [[City Council Meeting 241]] have an alibi (without saying the location)
He looks surprise, then quizzical. When branching to [[Shrine]], refuses to move forward. Mike goes there instead. Final question is, what did they want from us. We reply that they wanted us to stop doing [[Nobuske's Quest]]. He suggested offering them money, or to let him talk with them.
Suggested making jamming device as Mike was departing, without waiting for a response.

During long conversation, Nobuske uses obscure words associated with organized crime.

At Session 12, he called to tell us that "they've come for me", and have "chased me up the mountain". We all meet up at the [[Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop]]
