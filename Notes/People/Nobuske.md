The name is Nobuske and the surname is Kitagawa.

Landlord of our [[Apartment]]. Seems suspicious of everything.

Looks 65 years old, might be about 50.

Does not like Mike's name.

Knows me as Haruto.

Arrived in Wadayama from [[Kyoto]]. Neighbors do not like him and somebody wants to attack him. Says this confidently, but hides nervousness.

Showed us [[Nobuske's Threat]].
Gave us [[Nobuske's Quest]].

Asked about why there are many foreigners. Said that some live nearby (in the [[Chinese house|Chinese house]]?), and are quiet like mice "like they should be". Also [[Bikers]] occasionally drive, and the police don't care (but there are only two officers so maybe they're scared). Said we shouldn't care about this and there are more important things.

Asked about leads. Told him we were at school and supermarket. He told us about the Izakaya, could not remember the name. On evenings, the locals come there, a place of intrigue, fights and conflicts. Don't know who you can find there now but there are many people there in the evening.

After [[Knife Assault]], talked about [[Neurocalibrator]]. He does not care much about them.
Believes that they make people more crazy.
Offered the idea that someone is hacking people's neural implants to zombify them. ==To the best of our knowledge, this is false.==

[[Utsuji Hidehisa]] says he believes Nobuske is not who he claims to be.
His medical records are all technically valid, but they seem to have inconsistencies; feels like they have been gathered in parts from other people.

Offered to take part in the [[Festival]], but refused because he won't bend to them. But offered to scout out the festival to see anyone interesting. We will stay next to him and prevent people from approaching him.
