The name is Martin and the surname is Clyburn.

Only visitor to Supermarket on First day was a late-20s well dressed very-European with pale skin, freckles, red hair and a knitted hat. Has massive outdoor boots. Was reading magazines. Holds a multiuse bottle with green tea, filled from a nearby dispensary.
Mike complimented his bottle choice in Japanese, he was surprised then said with a French accent "thank you" in English.

He is at the [[Camping site]].

At the Second day, I asked him how he was using the [[Steve AI]]. He said hello, then his company said that they had barbeque that they could share, I sat down. 
[[Durbin Patrick]] is his friend.

They are two students, friends, they wanted to go to Thailand but there is a storm there so they went here at the last moment. Martin said there are many morning mists, very mysterious and atmospheric, very cool, he likes it here. Patrick says that it's nice here but nobody speaks Japanese so they can't. I told them about the [[Shrine]]. They said they saw it but nobody goes here.

Martin adds that in the fog, he saw a real ghost, but Patrick says he'd read too much folklore and went into too many forests.

Asked about talking to locals. They say it's difficult and they don't manage with the translator.

Asked about [[Kotobuke Ena]]. Patrick said he'd went to the Izakaya but people looked at her badly.
Patrick said he saw a girl on the roads (often at the [[Shrine]]), and he tried to contact her but she always shyly went away.

Said that they would stay until the [[Festival]]. They have a powerful laptop that they use to work.
