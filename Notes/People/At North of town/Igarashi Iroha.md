The name is Iroha and the surname is Igarashi.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] asked the lady for some wound treatment.
She takes out a small wooden box and carries it to him.
A healing compound is given to him.

Her voice is precise and does not look elderly.
Helped her husband with the [[Shrine]] but now doesn't do much.

Yarik said that he met [[Minato Yasonori|Minato-san]]. She says his husband is relentless, dispassionately.
Asked what she thinks, she says that on the one hand it would be a shame to lose such a thing if it is so old, but on the other hand Shinto talks about renewal. Either way, she doesn't get a vote.

Said that it's a shame that such things are going to the past. She is somewhat impressed, says she's glad to hear that someone of this generation here is interested in Shinto. There is only one good soul, [[Kyoko]] goes to trim the grass next to the shrine.

Asked if his help is needed. She said that if he could make the vegetable festival into what it was before, the husband would be happy.
The shrine needs an owner and without one it just stands there.
