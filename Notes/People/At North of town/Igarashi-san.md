On Third day, [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visited, told them that he knows about the [[Shrine]]. [[Igarashi-san]] said that the shrine has been maintained by his ancestors, avoids talking about the present. After prompting, says that he's afraid he'll be the last to keep it. Said that [[Kyoko]] goes there to keep check of the weeds. He says that the shrine's kami might have already left for the shrine's disrepair. Said that the festival was much better before. 
Note that [[Kyoko]] has moved in a year ago, and is tending to the shrine about 10 months, which matches the time that [[Matsuishi Kunio]] got disappeared.

Asked about [[Torii restoration]], he said that his ancestors deployed them so he won't let them be moved out. Said that he'll consider it if the [[Festival]] happens again. Asked him why he won't do it, he said that he's too old to go up to the shrine, that people don't want him, and that it's shameful since he's abandoned the subject. Said that he held the festival around 2011.

Asked about the rules for the festival: not too unusual, dedicated to [[Inari]]. Needs a portable shrine (in a [[Palanquin]], which needs restoration), move it up to the main shrine to pick up the spirit, then bring down to the city, have a feast, then bring the spirit back up. Note that there is a hard-to-spot gorge along the path that they nearly dropped the portable shrine into once.

Asked interesting facts about the city. Told about the missing teacher, they don't know much about it or him, but he did disappear.

Talked about fundraising for the [[Palanquin]].
Saw a violin case of a well-known manufacturer.
Belongs to [[Igarashi Iroha]], but doesn't play. Could be sold,
but she does not want to do it because it has sentimental value.


Asked about stolen katana.
Said that broke in, unlocked carefully, and only took sword.
Looking around, lots of antiques, and sword is next to all these things.
This sword is mid-19th century, but blade is much older, and in very good condition.
Said that saw person in traditional clothes and fox mask and with a sword that looks similar. But was not convinced that the sword seen matches the one we got.
