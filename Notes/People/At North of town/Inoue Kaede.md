#employed 

The name is Kaede and the surname is Inoue.


Works at the bar at [[Izakaya|The Terminus]].
[[Inoue Kyoko]] seems to be her daughter.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi-san]] told her that we are new here.
She was sorta distracted by her work.
Told her that we stay at the Apartment Building, she is sorta surprised by this.

Recommended the [[Festival]] to us because we're new.
Asked about where the crops come from, told that it comes from the neighboring towns.
Asked about the religious meaning, told that there was a shrine here but it hadn't been opened in a while, so the festival is secular; only [[Igarashi Yuusei]] probably remembers that.
