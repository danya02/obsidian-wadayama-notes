The name is Hidehisa and the surname is Utsuji.

Chief doctor at the [[Hospital]], but below [[Takanashi Ibuki]] in rank.

Was stabbed during [[Knife Assault]]. Gave us business card.

Doesn't seem to know what was going on when he was attacked. Both relieved to live and upset that [[Stabbing Assailant]] was killed.


[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] met him later in the [[Izakaya]].
Asked about [[Matsuishi Kunio]], said drawing webcomic. He responds, he shouldn't talk about patients, but it wouldn't hurt to say it now on condition of privacy. 
Said he complained about his [[Neurocalibrator]], claimed visions of fox that he talks to, that influences him to do certain things.
Didn't believe him, because he's a religious person, and that could be related to visions, but he came multiple times and it seemed to be a real concern.
Nevertheless, it would be strange if the neurocalibrator were at fault.

The neurocalibrator can shift emotions, but for that, the owner has to connect it to something.

Said that Matsuishi said the fox said that one of the citizens is very bad, so it told him to make a plan to "get rid of him". *We informed him that it was [[Nobusuke]].*
Matsuishi was scheduled to visit the [[Hospital]] to check the neurocalibrator when the neural implant machine was first installed.

Is aware of some of [[Matsuishi's Notebook]]'s contents. 

We told him that Nobuske said that he was tracked by someone. Said "if so, it wouldn't surprise me", but reluctant to continue. Will say only the following: doesn't like Nobuske very much, thinks there's something wrong with him. Doesn't know details, but had appointments with him. His documents are all in order, but medically speaking feels like they are assembled together from different sources. He thinks he's not the man he is.
