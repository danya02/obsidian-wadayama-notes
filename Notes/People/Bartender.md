Works at the bar at [[Izakaya|The Terminus]].
The [[Waitress]] seems to be her daughter.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi-san]] told her that we are new here.
She was sorta distracted by her work.
Told her that we stay at [[Apartment]], she is sorta surprised by this.

Recommended the [[Festival]] to us because we're new.
Asked about where the crops come from, told that it comes from the neighboring towns.
Asked about the religious meaning, told that there was a shrine here but it hadn't been opened in a while, so the festival is secular; only [[Igarashi-san]] probably remembers that.

At night, left the [[Izakaya]] and went into the [[Mansion]]. In about 15 minutes, left, holding a small thing in her hand. Then, went back into the Izakaya. Did not seem to be suspicious anything.
