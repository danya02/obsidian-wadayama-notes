The name is Akito and the surname is Edmunds.

First name is written 陽翔 and can be pronounced, in decreasing order of prevalence, Haruto, Hinata, Hinato, Hiroto, ==Akito==, Haruhi, Hyūga, Hibito, Yamato and Hikaru. This ambiguity is by design. The official pronounciation (used on documents) is Akito.

Last name is English-language, Edmunds, officially written as エッドムンド. Edamura/枝村 is an alternate version, used when the listener might not like foreigners.

Owns the [[Textile Kit]], which can be used to craft clothes and/or electronics.

The clothing he wears is of a semi-neo-traditional style but has been Boston-patched to include some jeans-like fabric. A spot on his sleeve contains a small Internet-connected circuit that can be used for quick two-way communication with his other electronic devices. 

On the First evening, spent 3Y for beer at the [[Izakaya]]. Total as of Session 2: 88Y.
