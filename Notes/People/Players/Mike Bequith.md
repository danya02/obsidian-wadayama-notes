The name is Mike and the surname is Bequith.

Seems to have some kind of spiritual ability that involves meditating at a place to gain additional information about that place. Was prompted about this by the GM at multiple points when he asked to stay at a place and observe. Maybe involves some kind of expendable power?

On the [[Session 3|Second evening]], helped [[Kagamihara Yuma]] with the gazebo and got +1 fatigue points. This caused him to use a Benny on a stealth check.

Maybe used the mystery ability on the [[Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop]].

Has basic (d4) hacking ability, but failed to hack the Mayor's Office, using two Bennies in the process.

Owns a bug/tracking device.
Has Hindrance: Convict.

Notice is d8.
Common Knowledge is d8.

Has some kind of neural implant.

As of Third night, has 1 Wound.
