The name is Mike and the surname is Bequith.

Seems to have some kind of spiritual ability that involves meditating at a place to gain additional information about that place. Was prompted about this by the GM at multiple points when he asked to stay at a place and observe. Maybe involves some kind of expendable power?

On the [[Session 3|Second evening]], helped [[Kagamihara Yuma]] with the gazebo and got +1 fatigue points. This caused him to use a Benny on a stealth check.

Maybe used the mystery ability on the [[Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop]].

Has basic (d4) hacking ability, but failed to hack the Mayor's Office, using two Bennies in the process.

Owns a bug/tracking device.
Has Hindrance: Convict.

Notice is d8.
Common Knowledge is d8.

Has some kind of neural implant.

As of Third night, has 1 Wound. Reset by start of Session 7.

On [[Session 7]], while on [[Mt Hakkai Road]], smartglasses start to lag a lot (a lot of network usage, but no anomalous processes).
Was downloading unknown code, of which fragments are recorded, and when opened to view text the lagging stopped.
Code is saved to disk.

Had 280Y.
Ordered code analysis for 90Y. 
Then gave 150Y to [[Nakamura Kotoha]].
Then bought 3 LED lamps for 3Y each.
Now has 31Y.

On Session 10, got answer about code analysis: AI generated code,
one of modules is for smartglasses backdooring,
program intended to track smartglasses with camera, microphone, GPS and sent via local network. Also does some other things, but don't know what they are.
Got refund of 45Y.

Found obscure smartglasses distro that is harder to hack and easier to notice happening.

On Session 11, bought axe for 10Y.

On Session 12, made radio jammer.
