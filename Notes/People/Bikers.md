We met them on [[Wadayama]]'s [[Main road]] going north towards [[Nantan]] on the [[Day 1|First day]].
They were playing Chinese dubstep.
Had LED biker's jackets with Chinese traditional elements.

Threw an aluminum can of coconut water (the Chinese like this but we don't) and cheap cigarette pack at [[Akito Edmunds|me]].
