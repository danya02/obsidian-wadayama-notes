alias: ["European tourist", "French tourist"]

Only visitor to [[Supermarket]] on [[Session 1]] was a late-20s well dressed very-European with pale skin, freckles, red hair and a knitted hat. Has massive outdoor boots. Was reading magazines. Holds a multiuse bottle with green tea, filled from a nearby dispensary.
[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] complimented his bottle choice in Japanese, he was surprised then said with a French accent "thank you" in English.

He is at the [[Camping site]].

At the [[Session 2|Second day]], I asked him how he was using the [[Steve AI]]. He said hello, then his company said that they had barbeque that they could share, I sat down. 
[[Patrick]] is his friend.

They are two students, friends, they wanted to go to Thailand but there is a storm there so they went here at the last moment. Martin said there are many morning mists, very mysterious and atmospheric, very cool, he likes it here. Patrick says that it's nice here but nobody speaks Japanese so they can't. I told them about the [[Shrine]]. They said they saw it but nobody goes here.

Martin adds that in the fog, he saw a real ghost, but Patrick says he'd read too much folklore and went into too many forests.
