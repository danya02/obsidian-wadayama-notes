6th year student, has upcoming exams.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] helped him with his exam prep at the [[Library]]. His father is [[Kagamihara Yuma]] and his mother is the police sheriff. Mother wants him to be more successful than her so he has to study hard, but he'd be fine working at the camping site like his father. Said that if Yarik meets [[Kagamihara Yuma|Yuma]] and tells him, he can get a discount at the camping.
