6th year student, has upcoming exams.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] helped him with his exam prep at the [[Library]]. His father is [[Kagamihara Yuma]] and his mother is the police sheriff. Mother wants him to be more successful than her so he has to study hard, but he'd be fine working at the camping site like his father. Said that if Yarik meets [[Kagamihara Yuma|Yuma]] and tells him, he can get a discount at the camping.

At the [[Session 4|Third day]], is at the library doing math. Yarik suggested helping him again; he asked why he's doing this, responded that he's bored. While helping math, told him about his plans and where in Japan he's been to, teachers we haven't met, games he's played, that they plan on going to Canada later.

Yarik tells him that [[Sandal Girl]] is interested in him. He responds that he thinks he isn't remarkable and doesn't know why she talks with him. Yarik says that it's probably the other way around, with how she is upset at him leaving.

He said that he doesn't know what she likes or how to get her interested. Yarik says that she is already interested in him so it doesn't matter what he might say. It seems that he's reached a conclusion, and after that he solves math tasks worse than usual.

Asked about [[Matsuishi Kunio]]. He said that he hasn't met him, refers to Mamiko. People didn't like to talk about him so he doesn't know.

On [[Session 7]], was in [[Library]] with [[Sandal Girl]]. Later, we followed them to [[Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop]], where they had a love confession scene.
