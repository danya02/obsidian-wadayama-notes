The name is Yuno and the surname is Takeda.

Shopkeeper is a 24-25 year old woman. Has north-Japanese accent. Was bored, but noticed 3 new people. Asked us if we lived here, told her we just arrived.
Was surprised that Nobuske was able to rent out the new place and that someone moved here; she lives next to our [[Apartment]] (probably at the [[Takeda Residence]])

Asked her why we rented so cheap. She said "everything in the city is so cheap. There is no rail for many years and everything with no rail access costs less."
Asked about interesting places, pointed to Mt Hakkai. There is camping there, said Martin is there.

Is almost the only employee at the supermarket. Also runs a second-hand electronics store.
