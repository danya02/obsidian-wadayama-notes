The surname is Fujiwara and the first name is Iori.

Probably lives at the [[Fujiwara Residence]]. [[Fujiwara Riko]] is probably related.

Over 40, somewhat fat, does not seem to care about his appearance. His face shows a kind of universal boredom we hadn't seen before. Has an empty beer glass. Is ever so slightly drunk.

The man was happy to see new people because nothing ever happens and he always sees the same faces.
We said that we see a lot of foreigners, and that there are missing people, so how can this be.
He noticed [[Tadashi Hamada|Tadashi-san]]'s clothes and asked us that he hopes that we are not like [[Kotobuke Ena|the woman]].
Asked about occupation, said he's an artist.
Man says he can't understand what the woman does for a living.
Said somebody works at Toshiba and someone else is a marketeer,
but she in particular is a mystery.


[[Akito Edmunds|I]] asked him about his job. He said he works remotely at the travel office in Kyoto, which is very boring. He's still happy to meet us because it's something to break the boredom.

As he got drunker, he wanted to confront the [[Kotobuke Ena]]. We managed to convince him not to.

As I asked him about what his name was, he gave [[Akito Edmunds|me]] the answer then blacked out.
