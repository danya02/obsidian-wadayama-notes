The name is Ena and the surname is Kotobuke.

About 30, pale skin, wearing the 2030s styled biker-styled clothes. Has a glass of whiskey with ice that is about half full.

She has a bespoke smartglasses, not a luxury item but rather a power user item.

She doesn't want to talk to us, or to anyone it seems.
She roughly told Yarik to get lost, then asked the [[Inoue|Bartender]] for another whiskey in a well-meaning tone of voice.
