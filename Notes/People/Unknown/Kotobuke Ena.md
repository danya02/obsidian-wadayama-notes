The name is Ena and the surname is Kotobuke.

About 30, pale skin, wearing the 2030s styled biker-styled clothes. Has a glass of whiskey with ice that is about half full.

She has a bespoke smartglasses, not a luxury item but rather a power user item.

She doesn't want to talk to us, or to anyone it seems.
She roughly told Yarik to get lost, then asked the [[Inoue|Bartender]] for another whiskey in a well-meaning tone of voice.

Ordered a package with unknown contents from Sony.

[[Kotobuke Hannah]] said that she works for some company in Osaka.

On Session 12, [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visited their house, the [[Kotobuke Residence]]. She recognizes him. He tells him that he wants part of the scale, which she bought -- she asks who told her that, then "[[Takeda Yuno|Supermarket Shopkeeper]]'s talkativeness should be directed to better ends". Leaves house, wearing home clothes; inside house is dark.

Mike asks her for parts, including some he doesn't need so she doesn't figure out the intentions. She asks what he's building -- she notices contradiction. She only gives one of the two parts he needs, taking the other one for herself.
