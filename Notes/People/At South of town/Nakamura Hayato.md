The name is Hayato and the surname is Nakamura.

Seems to be brother of [[Nakamura Kotoha]].
Teacher at [[School]].

Asked teacher about the course. Teacher values regular timetables, how many students won local contests. Heard some info about other teachers.
Asked about `Matsuishi Kunio`. Once mentioned, he says that he no longer works here and he doesn't know where he went. Whoever told us that he is here has outdated info.
He said that it isn't related to our school and they will find a different teacher.

Told that he is a remote relative. He is somewhat lost for words.
Told that he was an unusual person: rather religious, and he believes this is what done him in. The last time he was not himself, anxious and paranoid, which affected his work. One day he just disappeared.

Got work phone number.
