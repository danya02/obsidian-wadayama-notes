#schoolchild 


Child of [[Kotobuke Ena]].

Has retro gaming console, a geeky item. Can be used to play almost any videogame from the 2000s, given enough configuration.

On Session 11, [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] texted her to ask to play her video game. Replied to meet at [[South Clearing]]. Found her at shipping container.
Got reference to game guide from 2016, but playing the game is still very hard. However, he finally succeeds at the 12th attempt, and she said that she was trying it for over two weeks, earning her admiration.

Then asked about why she doesn't like the forest. When mentioning, she feels uneasy and answers evasively. Said that she hadn't told anyone before, but it's very scary. He replies that he won't laugh at this. Asks if he can make her mother not angry at her for this.

It was 1 year ago, when she was in year 4. ==([[Matsuishi Kunio]] disappeared before this.)==
Had sleepover at [[Kids' Party]]'s location.
There was a strong rain, and Ena let her go on her own.
She went to the forest instead, and she planned to go there from the start.
Got lost in the forest.
Went from [[Camping site]], then halfway to [[Shrine]] went north.
Slipped and rolled down the cliff.
Thankfully [[Mamiko]] covered for her and cleaned clothes.
==Down the cliff she saw a dead man.==
She should have reported this to the police, but her mom wouldn't have approved.
Please tell the police in a way that Ena doesn't get angry.

Ena has numbers and lots of code on smartglasses. Doesn't know much more about what she does.
