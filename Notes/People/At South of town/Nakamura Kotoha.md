Woodworker.

Older brother is [[Nakamura Hayato]].
Younger brother is [[Nakamura Ichiro]].

Quickly telling [[Nakamura Hayato]] about woodworking tips, he ignores her.

Asked about repairing the [[Palanquin]].
Received advance payment of 200Y to start working on it.

On session 9, said that we got more funding.
She was looking back to the direction where I came.
Asked if she's waiting for someone, she said no.
Did small talk, but she's waiting for something clearly.

Stealthed away to look at the road.
Message said "it's a bad idea to spy, let this be a lesson for you"
then smartglasses get bricked.
