The name is Kotoha and the surname is Nakamura.

Woodworker.

Older brother is [[Nakamura Hayato]].
Younger brother is [[Nakamura Ichirou]].

Quickly telling [[Nakamura Hayato]] about woodworking tips, he ignores her.

Asked about repairing the [[Palanquin]].
Received advance payment of 200Y to start working on it.

On session 9, said that we got more funding.
She was looking back to the direction where I came.
Asked if she's waiting for someone, she said no.
Did small talk, but she's waiting for something clearly.

Stealthed away to look at the road.
Message said "it's a bad idea to spy, let this be a lesson for you"
then smartglasses get bricked.

On Session 10, working on [[Palanquin]] happily.
[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visited to ask about her making the [[Fox masks]], as well as other items, for the festival. She didn't blink and replied that she does not make any masks, and probably will not have time for it.
Impatiently continues working while talking, so we leave.
Did not say this because it was supposed to be a surprise.
