Calligraphic sheet, crumpled then laid flat with carefully written text in an older Japanese style, as seen in school textbooks.

Contains threat: the city and those who keep it will not tolerate such a vile,  man as [[Nobusuke]], and we suggest that he leaves until end of spring, "or else".

Shown to us by [[Nobusuke]] on the [[Session 1|First day]].
