alias: ["Threat to Nobuske"]
---

Calligraphic sheet, crumpled then laid flat with carefully written text in an older Japanese style, as seen in school textbooks.

Contains threat: the city and those who keep it will not tolerate such a man as [[Nobuske]], and we suggest that he leaves until end of spring, "or else".

Shown to us by [[Nobuske]] on the [[Session 1|First day]].
