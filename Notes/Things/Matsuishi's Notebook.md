Paper notebook of 30 pages, 15 of those have untidy handwriting. Looks like a diary with no dates.

> “How long has it been since we first met? Half a year? With all those revelations time has slowed to a crawl. The [[Kamado Itsuki|mayor]]… and then that old man [[Nobusuke]]. I could not even imagine living next to such horrible people.”
> 
> “Bring 1580 yen in cash, leave any electronics at home.”
> 
> “Can focus on my work with all that pressure. Even had to cancel spring consultation, not that the kids were upset, though. I hope I am doing the right thing.”
>
> “Visited Nobusuke’s house and saw the poor man in the garden. Can not believe whatever I was told is true.”

There is a hand drawn plan of [[Apartment|Apartment building]]/Nobusuke’s house and his daily routine. He tends to stay in the lobby downstairs rather than in his flat. Large time intervals are marked as "stays at home". In the evening, 9PM-12AM, the curtains are drawn.

>
“I suppose it can not read my mind. Consult Doctor [[Takanashi Ibuki]] tomorrow, discreetly. This is going too far.”
>
“The doctor says he found nothing, but if that’s so how that fox is still not gone.”

(Latest entry's handwriting looks different, as though the writer had difficulty writing)
>“Whoever finds this, know that I, [[Matsuishi Kunio]], is not a killer. Whatever I could do from now on might not be under my total control. I will stop the fox before it gets me.”
