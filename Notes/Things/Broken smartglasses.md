Got broken by the [[Spirit of Wadayama]] on [[Session 9]],
while I was trying to spy on who [[Nakamura Kotoha]] was meeting.
She had made a fox mask previously, and was expected to hand it to someone.

Was previously hacked, with a terminal window showing text.
The last message was "it's a bad idea to spy, let this be a lesson to you". Before that, I had a conversation with [[Spirit of Wadayama]] in the forest near the [[Shrine]].
