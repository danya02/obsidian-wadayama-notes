==Provisional name. Does not have official name.==


A supposed phenomenon whereby a person with a [[Neurocalibrator]] or other kind of neural implant becomes violent because of it.

Many people in town believe that the [[Knife Assault]] is an example of this.

To the best of our knowledge, this is not a real thing.
It is made up by the yellow press, because the concept of tech driving people mad is very cyberpunk.
I remember some news story about someone going cyberpsycho and attacking someone or crashing a car or something -- not credible.

There is also a TV show whose plot is about this.

Regardless of reality, there is no public record of any neural implant-related violence in [[Wadayama]]. However, the police sheriff said that this is a repeat occurrence (???).
