[[Kamado Itsuki|Kamado-san]] asked [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] to ask about this at the [[City Council Meeting 241]].

[[Clyburn Martin]] confirmed that these happen. During the month that they're here it has happened 3 or 4 times. [[Durbin Patrick]] says he'd like to take part in an open-air party as well.

Will likely take place at Session 10 at midnight.

Is in fact just a party, but [[Kamado Itsuki|Kamado-san]] would seek to find any reason to inconvenience [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] for not giving him the appropriate amount of bribe.
