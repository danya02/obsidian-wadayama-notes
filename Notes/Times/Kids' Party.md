Will take place in the evening in the [[Fujiwara Residence]]
[[Fujiwara Riko]] asked us to visit this: the party intersects the [[City Council Meeting 241]], which she attends.
Check in at 9. Check in at 11 to tell them to go to bed.

Participants:
- [[Fujiwara Toma]]
- [[Kagamihara Arato|Kagamihara-kun]]
- [[Takanashi Mamiko]]
- [[Kotobuke Hana]]

When [[Tadashi Hamada]] visited, [[Takanashi Mamiko]] answered the door and seemed surprised, but then said that everything is okay.
Heard arguments about what temperature to set the microwave to so it doesn't explode.
Talking about popcorn package, it is not in English but in Latin language.

[[Kotobuke Hana]] offered Yarik to play a level of [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste).
Couldn't do it easily, but the kids were happy looking at this.

Talking about the Festival, they said that they should go to `Mt Hakkai|Mountaintop`. There's a cliff you should not fall off and into the forest.

[[Kotobuke Hana]] does not like talking about the forest.

Yarik draws an image of them.

[[Fujiwara Toma|Fujiwara-kun]] approached Yarik. He has a non-mainstream, well-drawn manga on it. He admires the image, not paying attention to that it's a drawing of them. Says that he's drawing them.

Asked if he's a professional. Was surprised that people are doing art here. Says he wants to learn to be a mangaka, talking about the different styles of what he has. Note that he was quiet before this.
Says he wants to go to the Nagoya Academy or Kyoto University.

Says only other art person is [[Nakamura Kotoha]] but she does woodworking, said that he saw her making a fox mask for the festival.
Saying that he hadn't been spying too much, he thinks that Yarik thinks he has. He heard that she said that she'll be giving it away to someone at 11PM on Session 9.

Conclude that [[Fujiwara Toma|Fujiwara-kun]] has potential.
He asked about social media account -- succeeded in giving him the non-NSFW one.
