On [[Session 5|Third evening]] Smartglasses received message about "strange subject" in the neighborhood, not to interact with any unknown people, to stay in your home.

Saw a trail blood on the building next to the bridge to south of town. Police said that it might be a violent person and said not to follow the trail. 

Heard a piercing male scream from the clearing to the SWW of the bridge.
Went to investigate: there are two cargo containers on there.
There are two men, one is [[Utsuji Hidehisa]], >40 lying face down, bleeding out, was stabbed in stomach 3 times
The other is [[Stabbing Assailant]]: *about 2m tall*, thin, wearing long trenchcoat kimono with bag over shoulder, has hobby knife in hand. Does not stealth around. About 20yo, glassed-over look on face, looks unresponsive.

Mike distracted him, he started going towards him, but then Yarik drew his attention back. Dan and Mike moved in to hit him, and then police arrived and shot him.


Doctors in ambulance are [[Takanashi Ibuki]] and [[Fujiwara Riko]]. 

Saw [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] and [[Kotobuke Ena]] and [[Inoue]] and [[Kyoko]] in crowd. Kyoko has itching neck (also has neurocalibrator).

Crowd whispers rumors about how stabber has neurocalibrator and they go crazy. Kyoko is uncomfortable and leaves.

See three blue-collar workers debating neurocalibrators.
[[Inoue]] talks with similar-aged woman about how horrible the event is and how fortunate we were here.
When met [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]], offered him free drink at [[Izakaya]].

At [[Izakaya]], center of attention is [[Utsuji Hidehisa]] with light beer recounting the story.
[[Inoue]] pointed out [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] when he arrived, was offered a bottle of *Hokkaido Special* for free.
Talked to [[Utsuji Hidehisa]].
[[Kotobuke Ena]] is at the bar. Tried talking to her, but was uninterested.


After, [[Kagamihara Himari]] says too much work handling the incident;
this is not to be expected from working in the town. 
[[Stabbing Assailant]] must have been from Osaka.

Yarik left bar and talked to [[Igarashi Iroha]]. Said that this only happened 30 years ago: a family lived here, husband and wife argued, and wife stabbed husband. Unknown what happened after.
Festival in 4 days. Will have fireworks, which have a religious meaning, though forgotten.
