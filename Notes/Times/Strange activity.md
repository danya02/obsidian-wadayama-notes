On [[Session 5|Third evening]] Smartglasses received message about "strange subject" in the neighborhood, not to interact with any unknown people, to stay in your home.

Saw a trail blood on the building next to the bridge to south of town. Police said that it might be a violent person and said not to follow the trail. 

Heard a piercing male scream from the clearing to the SWW of the bridge.
Went to investigate: there are two cargo containers on there.
There are two men, one is >40 lying face down, bleeding out, was stabbed in stomach 3 times
Other is about 2m tall, thin, wearing long trenchcoat kimono with bag over shoulder, has hobby knife in hand. Does not stealth around. About 20yo, glassed-over look on face, looks unresponsive.

Mike distracted him, he started going towards him, but then Yarik drew his attention back. Dan and Mike moved in to hit him, and then police arrived and shot him.
