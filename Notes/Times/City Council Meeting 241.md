Will take place at the `Library`

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] deployed a listening device on the library. 
Then he was designated as a representative of [[Kamado Itsuki|Kamada-san]], will attend in exchange for saying some things.

Mike's instructions are: [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] has parties/events at the `Camping site`. Find the date when the next one is, without revealing that he was sent to get this.


Saw:
- [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]], [[Kagamihara Himari]], [[Police deputy]],
- [[Kotobuke Ena]], looking bored
- [[Fujiwara Iori|Fujiwara-san]], [[Fujiwara Riko]]
- [[Takanashi Ibuki]], [[Takanashi Kanna]]
- [[Igarashi Iroha]] -- was surprised to meet [[Mike Bequith|Mike]]

[[Kagamihara Himari]] is the meeting leader.
[[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] quickly looked in anger at Mike when he was announced.

Opinions on the [[Knife Assault]] are mixed: an option is to have a curfew, but is mainly ignored.
[[Kagamihara Himari]] talks derisively on the `Neurocalibrator`.
[[Takanashi Ibuki]] agrees that this is likely an isolated incident, however he says that the `Neurocalibrator` *might have* played a role in it.
Mike offered to encourage check-ups at the hospital, but was mainly ignored.

On the `Festival`, many bureaucratic questions.
Mike talks about restoring the traditional festival. Impresses people with knowledge about it.
Talking about funding, [[Fujiwara Iori|Fujiwara-san]] asks how we can help. Said [[Nakamura Kotoha]] is working on it, and got funded by 6 people for 224Y.

Miscellaneous questions: fixing roads, new networks, anti-delivery-drone petition (3 months yet), school questions etc.
At this time, [[Kotobuke Ena]] leaves -- was looking bored throughout, but was the most bored here.

Talked to [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]]. Said that `Clyburn Martin` told him about the `Rumored Party`, referring to it as a "tea party".
He responds that they do gather occasionally, hoping they don't disturb them too much.
Said that he will "invite him sometime" (this means likely not).

Talks about how the mayor doesn't care about tradition, and is more interested in the commercial side.

Says that the `Rumored Party` is not a traditional event, rather it is a friend meetup.
Responds that the mayor isn't from here, and only cares about finances and politics.

[[Fujiwara Iori]] talks about how his son wants to study at an art academy.
[[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] talks about how budget increases are needed so that the police can deal with this.

Mike tried asking him around when the `Rumored Party` is.
It appears that the party is going to happen tomorrow at midnight.
It doesn't seem that he knows that he figured it out.
