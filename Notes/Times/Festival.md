Advertised by the [[Festival Poster]].
An agricultural festival where local goods and crops can be bought.
It should be religious-related but we spot no reference to the related shrine. Probably it is the [[Shrine]].

In the morning, the agricultural events are being prepared.
Saw [[Kagamihara Yuma]] and [[Fujiwara Riko]] assembling stands, kids on squares, and [[Igarashi-san]] and [[Igarashi Iroha]] at their house.

Never took place because of the events of the final day.
