Ambulance arrived.
Doctors in ambulance are [[Takanashi Ibuki]] and [[Fujiwara Riko]]. 

Saw [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]] and [[Kotobuke Ena]] and [[Inoue Kaede]] and [[Inoue Kyoko]] in crowd. Kyoko has itching neck (also has neurocalibrator).

Crowd whispers rumors about how stabber has neurocalibrator and they go crazy. Kyoko is uncomfortable and leaves.

See three blue-collar workers debating neurocalibrators.
[[Inoue Kaede]] talks with similar-aged woman about how horrible the event is and how fortunate we were here.
When met [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]], offered him free drink at [[Izakaya]].

At [[Izakaya]], center of attention is [[Utsuji Hidehisa]] with light beer recounting the story.
[[Inoue Kaede]] pointed out [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] when he arrived, was offered a bottle of *Hokkaido Special* for free.
Talked to [[Utsuji Hidehisa]].
[[Kotobuke Ena]] is at the bar. Tried talking to her, but was uninterested.


After, [[Kagamihara Himari]] says too much work handling the incident;
this is not to be expected from working in the town. 
`Stabbing Assailant` must have been from Osaka.

Yarik left bar and talked to [[Igarashi Iroha]]. Said that this only happened 30 years ago: a family lived here, husband and wife argued, and wife stabbed husband. Unknown what happened after.
Festival in 4 days. Will have fireworks, which have a religious meaning, though forgotten. 

Randomly came here from another city, and went insane. A neurocalibrator was supposed to help, but didn't.
