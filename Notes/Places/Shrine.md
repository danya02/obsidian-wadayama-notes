Is at the top of the mountain. [[Mt Hakkai Road]] leads here.

There are some torii leading up to it.

There is a 50-year-old [[Minato Yasonori]] with white hair and a large tablet here. Notices us, bows and returns to recording the torii.

When [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] washes his hands at the entrance, the man asked if the shrine wasn't functioning anymore.
Mike answers that even if it isn't, the linked kami is still here.
The man responds that the torii are surprising; they are from a Meiji time period but are still standing.

They want to restore the torii. They can't restore the torii here because it's difficult to bring a group of restorers to such an abandoned place.

I notice a weak smell of incense from the main entrance of the shrine.
There is a barely-noticeable path to the back of the shrine.
On the back side of this there is a laminated photo of an about 20-year-old man, maybe student-aged with a very sad face, wearing an inconspicuous neo-traditional.
Incense is usually used when a person has died.


Visited on [[Session 8]]. On the road, saw a spotted wild boar.
Grass around shrine was matted down. Has incense that was used within the day. Footsteps around going to/from the main road, around the shrine and north to the forest.

Visited on [[Session 9]]. Tried following the footsteps, into the forest wilderness, but could not find anything. Then terminal popup in glasses, their text in 19th century style

"what are you looking for in the woods", in 19th century style. Wrote "I mean no harm". They responded "i know about your friends".

"what should we stop doing"
"it's obvious, don't investigate. this nobuske is an enemy of the city, do not do what he tells you"
"we know he's bad, and do not intend to"
"I know you want to restore festival, the city likes this. questions about nobuske will be solved quickly, do not worry about this"
"what exactly should we not do?"
"such ignorant tailor, do not go around the forest at night and stop investigating everything, the spirit of the city does not like it"
Then flashlight turns off and does not turn back on.
"thank you for your time, I'll be going now"
+1 fatigue
Flashlight turns on when I cross the river.

When [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] goes there, hears distorted electronic voice saying "it seems that the first warning was not enough", sounds that though distorted it was originally a female voice, source is not at middle range behind him.
Replies "warnings work if you care for them" and keeps walking.
Voice responds "I don't like pointless bloodshed in sacred mountains, you should go" from somewhere closer by.
Says "someone clearly wants to kill me, for why if one of my goals is the [[Festival]]"
Hearing "you people do many vile things for your (lord), but this is your last warning: leave this forest, and maybe this city, and do not interfere. I know everything about you, you cannot hide from the protector spirit of the city"
Says "why did you decide that we do this for our (lord) because it is our own desire, if you know so much then you must know it's an honest desire"
"I saw you with [[Nobuske]] here, do not think that fog and bamboo can hide your speeches from me. Go back the way you came."
Saw a figure in a large kimono that hides form, but seems female. Has [[Fox masks]] of lacquered wood. Voice saying "go while the spirits are well-meaning" coming from the mask.
Figure is neither tall nor short.
Has half-antique sword holstered in belt.
From behind the collar to the neck, saw a computer cable.

As he goes out to the shrine's clearing, says "wonder what [[Kotobuke Ena]] is doing".
