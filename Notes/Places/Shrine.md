Is at the top of the mountain. [[Mt Hakkai Road]] leads here.

There are some torii leading up to it.

There is a 50-year-old [[Minato Yasonori]] with white hair and a large tablet here. Notices us, bows and returns to recording the torii.

When [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] washes his hands at the entrance, the man asked if the shrine wasn't functioning anymore.
Mike answers that even if it isn't, the linked kami is still here.
The man responds that the torii are surprising; they are from a Meiji time period but are still standing.

They want to restore the torii. They can't restore the torii here because it's difficult to bring a group of restorers to such an abandoned place.

I notice a weak smell of incense from the main entrance of the shrine.
There is a barely-noticeable path to the back of the shrine.
On the back side of this there is a laminated photo of an about 20-year-old man, maybe student-aged with a very sad face, wearing an inconspicuous neo-traditional.
Incense is usually used when a person has died.
