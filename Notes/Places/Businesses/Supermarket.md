[[Takeda Yuno]] is here.

Sometimes has orders delivered to it. [[Nobuske]] has asked us to get his order from it.

Chain supermarket of an unknown chain.

On First day, saw [[Martin]] there.

On Third day, shopkeeper passed a box to the [[Kotobuke Ena]] that is the size of a tablet but slightly thicker. Box has no postal markings. Woman chats with shopkeeper friendly. When takes box, looks pleased, but maybe slightly sinister look. Exits and goes south.

When asked, said (as though it's obvious) that information about orders doesn't get revealed. Tried asking anyway, got name.

[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] got hired to deliver packages around town for 2Y per delivery.

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] got the parts needed to gather the radio jammer device for 40Y.
[[Kotobuke Ena]] bought one of the parts that he needs.
