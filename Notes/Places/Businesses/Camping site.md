There is an izba-like building here.

There is only one camping tent here, acid-blue color, looks expensive.
Next to a small campfire in portable chairs there are two people. One is [[Clyburn Martin|Martin]], another is [[Durbin Patrick]]. Smells like meat and strong coffee.

Heard sound of axe, on the other side of the camping is [[Kagamihara Yuma]].
[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] comes up to him. He asks if we want to rent a place. He is the owner of the place, but it's off-season but we could rent any spot.
The view at the place isn't that great so since we were here we're new here. We said we're new in town.


[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] suggested helping [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]], he gave him an axe to work on the gazebo and said thank you.

On Session 9, visited here. Smells like onion and cheese.
Asked about Rumored Party.

On Session 11, went there. Saw light in Patrick and Martin's, as well as Kagamihara Yuma with 2 boxes (~48 cans) of beer, drinking one and looking at the night city.
Say we found a corpse.
We come to him. He's surprised to see us at such a late hour, then asks "what corpse?" Say, of `Matsuishi Kunio`. He says, let's tell the police about this. We say that we saw a strange person there, went with police before, then went with friend there.
He says that it's not surprising that this went missing. Says that he told them about it, and that wife/sheriff is coming. In 15 minutes, [[Kagamihara Himari]] is there, says "what is it now". Confirmed that this is him. We told her that we were being hacked 3 times. As we were telling that we were being hacked, Mike's smartglasses reverted to normal.
