There is an izba-like building here.

There is only one camping tent here, acid-blue color, looks expensive.
Next to a small campfire in portable chairs there are two people. One is [[Martin|Martin]], another is [[Patrick]]. Smells like meat and strong coffee.

Heard sound of axe, on the other side of the camping is [[Kagamihara Yuma]].
[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] comes up to him. He asks if we want to rent a place. He is the owner of the place, but it's off-season but we could rent any spot.
The view at the place isn't that great so since we were here we're new here. We said we're new in town.


[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] suggested helping [[Kagamihara Yuma|Kagamihara-san]], he gave him an axe to work on the gazebo and said thank you.

On Session 9, visited here. Smells like onion and cheese.
