On Third day, saw two people inside:
- the [[Kagamihara Himari]], a military-looking woman with well-fitting uniform and a missing eye implant
- [[Police deputy]], a 30 man resembling a fish, thin and aerodynamic with bulging eyes, boredly looking at the PC

[[Akito Edmunds|Akito]] and [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visited to ask for quests. The sheriff greets us, and asked if we have any new  info. We complained about the [[Bikers]], and they said they know about it already. Mike tried taunting her, and she responded with quite a lot of racist terms towards Chinese immigrants; complained about lack of reinforcements. Claimed that [[Liao Tingni|Tingni]] is part of the gang. 

On Session 11, [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] came there and told that he found something strange in forest. They lock the station and go into the forest.
Saying that he went to the [[Shrine]], and then saw footprints. Followed, saw something like body bag, and person with long item.
Found old footsteps, and led them following the path.
Said that when they were younger, the forest was much less difficult to traverse.
Said that he missed it, returned to where he went,
and then said that he saw something strange,
then heard reply, and saw [[Spirit of Wadayama]], describing in detail has kimono and fox mask and katana. Before, said that this could be a tourist, but afterwards looked like they don't believe it. Collected some details and also asked him if he was okay: if Mike feels unwell, they offer to lead him to [[Hospital]], where he accepts going.
