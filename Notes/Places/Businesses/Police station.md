On Third day, saw two people inside:
- the [[Police sheriff]], a military-looking woman with well-fitting uniform and a missing eye implant
- [[Police deputy]], a 30 man resembling a fish, thin and aerodynamic with bulging eyes, boredly looking at the PC

[[Akito Edmunds|Akito]] and [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] visited to ask for quests. The sheriff greets us, and asked if we have any new  info. We complained about the [[Bikers]], and they said they know about it already. Mike tried taunting her, and she responded with quite a lot of racist terms towards Chinese immigrants; complained about lack of reinforcements. Claimed that [[Liao Tingni|Tingni]] is part of the gang.
