Also has the [[Supermarket]] and the [[Library]].
Probably [[Kamada Itsuke]] is here.

Outside on the [[Session 2|First evening]], noticed a group of people putting up the [[Festival Poster]].


An [[Old Lady]] was complaining that the poster covers a [[Missing Person Poster]]. The work crew says that it's been there for over a year and they should take it down.

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] tried asking about this person. Got asked if we're new here. Told that we moved recently, had to also tell about location. We said that we're staying at the [[Camping site]], got warned about rain that could make it difficult to live there in 3 days. She had only seen [[Martin]] there.

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] said he'd heard about [[Nobuske]] at the [[Supermarket]] and asked for opinion. She said she didn't know he rented out, said she has not contacted with him much but she doesn't like her because he looked at her dismissively.


On [[Session 3|Second evening]], heard an argument in [[Kamada Itsuke|Kamada-san]]'s office. One of the voices is [[Nobuske]], asking questions to someone with an "acid", unfriendly voice.
Nobuske says he gives him a percentage of his rent and does not.
The other responds that he does not understand what the purpose of his enquiry is.
Nobuske responds that he knows all about him and he still has his old skills, so don't think he can get away with this.
Nobuske leaves, and he is very angry and scary-looking.
The other is 50-60, but looks very good, a formal kimono, but his voice makes one feel small.

Yarik asked what the issue was, he responded by asking if we're doing progress with his task.

Nobuske said that we ought to investigate [[Kamada Itsuke|Kamada-san]] now.
