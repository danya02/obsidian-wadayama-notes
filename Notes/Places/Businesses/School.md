As we arrived, school year has come to an end.

Heard that the trolleybus prices to [[Nantan]] have raised by 3Y.
Heard that people swim in River Katsura.
Heard that people ride to school on the [[Intercity trolleybus]].
Heard that there is forecast of heavy rain in about 3 days.
Heard that students will no longer need to come to school because the year is over.

Saw a man of 35-40 with olive suit and square smartglasses, above average height, very thin, speaks with teacher's voice to group of 4 5/6-greaders (2 boys, 2 girls)


One of the boys is Chinese: kimono has Chinese-style attributes. ([[Liao Tingni|Liao]]) Teacher ([[Nakamura Hayato]]) gives homework: if need help, come to school, specified days to visit. All 4 are locals, others come here from other cities.
Probably [[Kagamihara Arato|Kagamihara-kun]], [[Kotobuke Hannah]], [[Fujiwara Toma|Fujiwara-kun]], [[Liao Tingni|Liao]]
[[Liao Tingni]] went south.

At gate, saw a guard booth with a man over 60 in semi-formal clothes. Told him I'm looking to enroll in the school. He says the only one there is the math teacher.

Saw [[Fujiwara Toma]] and [[Takanashi Mamiko]] and [[Liao Tingni]]. Guard says if teacher is running late, they say Mr [[Nakamura Hayato]] is indeed running late.
The children are copying some of the homework from each other.

Asked the children how do they like the school; they say "OK".
Told them that I'd like to enroll a student of 5th or 6th year. The girl with the blond hair and unisex clothes told me that the birdwatching club is the best.

Asked teacher about the course. Teacher values regular timetables, how many students won local contests. Heard some info about other teachers.
Asked about [[Matsuishi Kunio]]. Once mentioned, he says that he no longer works here and he doesn't know where he went. Whoever told us that he is here has outdated info.
He said that it isn't related to our school and they will find a different teacher.

Told that he is a remote relative. He is somewhat lost for words.
Told that he was an unusual person: rather religious, and he believes this is what done him in. The last time he was not himself, anxious and paranoid, which affected his work. One day he just disappeared.

Got work phone number.
