As we arrived, school year has come to an end.

Heard that the trolleybus prices to [[Nantan]] have raised by 3Y.
Heard that people swim in [[River Katsura|the river]].
Heard that people ride to school on the [[Intercity trolleybus]].
Heard that there is forecast of heavy rain in about 3 days.
Heard that students will no longer need to come to school because the year is over.

Saw a man of 35-40 with olive suit and square smartglasses, above average height, very thin, speaks with teacher's voice to group of 4 5/6-greaders (2 boys, 2 girls). One of the boys is Chinese: kimono has Chinese-style attributes. Teacher gives homework: if need help, come to school, specified days to visit. All 4 are locals, others come here from other cities. 3 Japanese people are together, the Chinese one is different.
[[Liao Tingni]] went south (maybe to the [[Unusual house|Chinese house]]?)
