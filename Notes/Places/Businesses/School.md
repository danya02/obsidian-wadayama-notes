As we arrived, school year has come to an end.

Heard that the trolleybus prices to `Nantan` have raised by 3Y.
Heard that people swim in River Katsura.
Heard that people ride to school on the [[Intercity trolleybus]].
Heard that there is forecast of heavy rain in about 3 days.
Heard that students will no longer need to come to school because the year is over.

Saw a man of 35-40 with olive suit and square smartglasses, above average height, very thin, speaks with teacher's voice to group of 4 5/6-greaders (2 boys, 2 girls)


One of the boys is Chinese: kimono has Chinese-style attributes. ([[Liao Tingni|Liao]]) Teacher ([[Nakamura Hayato]]) gives homework: if need help, come to school, specified days to visit. All 4 are locals, others come here from other cities.
Probably [[Kagamihara Arato|Kagamihara-kun]], [[Kotobuke Hana]], [[Fujiwara Toma|Fujiwara-kun]], [[Liao Tingni|Liao]]
[[Liao Tingni]] went south.

At gate, saw a guard booth with a man over 60 in semi-formal clothes. Told him I'm looking to enroll in the school. He says the only one there is the math teacher.

Saw [[Fujiwara Toma]] and [[Takanashi Mamiko]] and [[Liao Tingni]]. Guard says if teacher is running late, they say Mr [[Nakamura Hayato]] is indeed running late.
The children are copying some of the homework from each other.

Asked the children how do they like the school; they say "OK".
Told them that I'd like to enroll a student of 5th or 6th year. The girl with the blond hair and unisex clothes told me that the birdwatching club is the best.
