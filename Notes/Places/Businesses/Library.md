Occupies the 2nd floor of the town hall building.
Also has the [[Mayor's Office]] and the [[Supermarket]].

It is very quiet, but there is an argument in the [[Mayor's Office]], closer to the river. 
[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] went to explore the admin section, walked past a reception with a late-student-aged receptionist.

Learned information about [[Wadayama]].

There is [[Kagamihara Arato|a student]] learning geometry here.


We now have his text chat contact.

I looked up the [[Apartment|Apartment building]]. It was built in 1993, and the land was empty before. Not sure how many owners switched, but it was always meant for living space.
It is still the original building. Owners are not publicly known.


While we were at the library, we saw the nerd with the reader and the girl with the sandals. The third, who is probably [[Hannah]], has blonde dyed hair and a unisex kimono that does not show gender. From window, saw talking, then go towards main road.

At 6, Mayor left and went to the right (towards the river) from the building exit.
We tracked him out the building, saw him go into the 2-floor cottage next to the river.
There is a brass plate saying [[Kamada Itsuke|Kamada]] on the gate.
