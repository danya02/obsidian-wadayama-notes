alias: ["The Terminus", "Terminus"]

A kind of traditional bar or pub.

[[Igarashi Mansion]] is across the road.

Can only fit about 20 people, is somewhat smaller than a school classroom. 5 tables.
About 7 people from 25 to 40 years old were here on the [[Session 2|First evening]]. Notable ones are:
- behind the counter, the [[Inoue Kaede|Bartender]] looks about 35, wearing a work kimono out of jeans fabric, has a long black ponytail
- at the bar, two people:
	- [[Fujiwara Iori]] 
	- [[Kotobuke Ena]]
- [[Inoue Kyoko]], a girl of about 16, in a work kimono of jeans fabric, gets an order from someone at the table. Has long hair that covers her head from 3 sides. Noticed us but quickly returned to her work. We consider that the bar is not a reasonable place for schoolchildren to work in.

Has two floors, the top floor is a living space.

Saw an old couple, the man is [[Igarashi Yuusei]] wearing a home robe, and the lady is [[Igarashi Iroha]] wearing a semi-formal kimono and smoking a traditional pipe.
