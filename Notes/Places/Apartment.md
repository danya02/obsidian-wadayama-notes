Where we all met. [[My flat]] is there.

6 flats with 6 windows.

[[Nobuske]] says: the building was abandoned, owned by someone who died without inheritance, then 7 years owned by state, then he bought it, and we can verify it with the property roster. Says other people might have claims about it but he does not care.
