Also has the [[Supermarket]] and the [[Library]].
Probably [[Kamada Itsuke]] is here.

Outside on the [[Session 2|First evening]], noticed a group of people putting up the [[Festival Poster]].


An [[Old Lady]] was complaining that the poster covers a [[Missing Person Poster]]. The work crew says that it's been there for over a year and they should take it down.

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] tried asking about this person. Got asked if we're new here. Told that we moved recently, had to also tell about location. We said that we're staying at the [[Camping site]], got warned about rain that could make it difficult to live there in 3 days. She had only seen [[Martin]] there.

[[Mike Bequith|Mike]] said he'd heard about [[Nobuske]] at the [[Supermarket]] and asked for opinion. She said she didn't know he rented out, said she has not contacted with him much but she doesn't like her because he looked at her dismissively.
