This is where [[Akito Edmunds|Akito]] lives.

About the size of a Puschino flat. Fairly deteriorated. One window. Table for sitting on the floor at and wall-mounted wardrobe. View to the north-east to [[Mt Hakkai|a tall mountain]] with forests; mountain is so tall that the top can't be seen from inside the flat.
