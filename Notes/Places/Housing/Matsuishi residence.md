Probably belongs to [[Matsuishi Kunio]]

Overgrown with weeds. Power is disconnected.

Mike climbs over the fence and unlocks the door despite having no lockpicking knowledge.

Seems that only one man lived here.
[[Matsuishi's School Journal]] is here.

Has many Shinto-related items.
Has a [kamidana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamidana) which is a small household shrine.

Many things are out of place: stacks of old books are carefully placed on floor.
Drawer of kitchen utensils has been put on countertop instead of in.

On floor, 20-25cm shards of ceramic fox statue.
Small miniature souvenir torii lay broken, probably have been broken intentionally.

Desktop computer with lid removed, there is an SSD inside but disconnected. Contents are encrypted, requires password. Mike picked this up and tried running a script to bruteforce the password.

On living room table, cardboard boxes of unknown medicines.

There are books on Japanese history, about teaching at middle school, and [[Matsuishi's Notebook]].

On Session 12, found robot dog to disassemble, as well as a contact info with 1580 written on it. It seems that this is arranging a deal to buy a 9mm Colt firearm using a temporary contact.
