Where we all met. [[My flat]] is there.

6 flats with 6 windows.

[[Nobuske]] says: the building was abandoned, owned by someone who died without inheritance, then 7 years owned by state, then he bought it, and we can verify it with the property roster. Says other people might have claims about it but he does not care.

[[Akito Edmunds|Akito]], [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] and [[Tadashi Hamada|Hamada]] live here. [[Nobuske]] is the landlord. He rents this to us for free, on condition that we complete [[Nobuske's Quest]].
