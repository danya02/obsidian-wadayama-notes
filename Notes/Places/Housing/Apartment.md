Where we all met. [[My flat]] is there.

6 flats with 6 windows.

[[Nobusuke]] says: the building was abandoned, owned by someone who died without inheritance, then 7 years owned by state, then he bought it, and we can verify it with the property roster. Says other people might have claims about it but he does not care.

[[Akito Edmunds|Akito]], [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] and [[Tadashi Hamada|Hamada]] live here. [[Nobusuke]] is the landlord. He rents this to us for free, on condition that we complete [[Nobuske's Quest]].

On the Third day, Mike spies on [[Nobusuke]]'s conversation in the flat.
Heard that he talks in Japanese-Okinawan; only facts heard are "Osaka" and "tasty cheese".
Seems happier than usual.

Explored the house. Didn't see anything unusual on the outside, but met Nobuske.
Told him that he's looking if there aren't any skeletons kept here; he pointed him towards the cemetery behind the school; then he asked whether any progress has been made, to which our answer is no. He went around the corner and was gone; the flat was locked with an old mechanical lock.
Mike tries lockpicking the lock; Nobuske spots him. Said that he knows Nobuske isn't telling everything about him, so he wanted info; he counters that he hired him to look for info on others and not himself.
