Looks very authentically Japanese. Base made of concrete but mainly built of wood.

[[Igarashi-san]], the old keeper of the [[Shrine]], is probably here.
His wife, [[Igarashi Iroha]], can be seen on the terrace.

There is an over-80 lady on the terrace in semi-formal kimono and smoking a traditional Japanese pipe, looking up at the mountains. We saw her with an old man in the same place in the [[Session 2|First evening]] as we went to the [[Izakaya]] across the road.

Glimpsed inside. There are paintings and classical lacquered furniture, all looks very expensive.
