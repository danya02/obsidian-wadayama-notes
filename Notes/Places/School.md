As we arrived, school year is almost over.

Heard that the trolleybus prices to north city have raised by 3Y.
Heard that people swim in the river.
Heard that people ride to school on the [[Intercity trolleybus]].
Heard that there is forecast of heavy rain in about 3 days, and because of this students will not go to school.

Saw a man of 35-40 with olive suit and square smartglasses, above average height, very thin, speaks with teacher's voice to group of 4 5/6-greaders (2 boys, 2 girls). One of the boys is Chinese: kimono has Chinese-style attributes. Teacher gives homework: if need help, come to school, specified days to visit. All 4 are locals, others come here from other cities. 3 Japanese people are together, the Chinese one is different.
The Chinese student went south (maybe to the [[Unusual house|Chinese house]]?)
