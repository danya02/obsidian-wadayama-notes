alias: ["Mountain", "Mountaintop"]
---

Refers to the top of the mountain, not to the other places reachable with the [[Mt Hakkai Road]].

Wooden barriers.
Few benches for sitting outward.
Note saying which other places are visible; in clear weather it's possible to see Kyoto from here.

Appears to be a moderately popular place with the locals.


We saw [[Liao Tingni]] and [[Kyoko]] there. They were discussing random school topics. The boy has a Chinese accent but a large vocabulary.

He asks her if she's all right, she responds that she went to the doctor and she will come back tomorrow; her voice sounds cheerful but maybe slightly faked. 

He took out a firecracker from his pocket and tossed it, a firework seen in daylight. Civilian fireworks are slightly illegal.

Mike went next to them and said something about the goodness of living in the mountains. The kids had been somewhat spooked out by this; Kyoko said she needed to go back home to help.

Waited there then heard people coming up the steps. There is a boy and girl voice. These are 5th year students.
It seems that the [[Fujiwara Toma]] is a stereotypical "nerd", even if we do not refer to people like that: thin, clumsily moves, light-blue kimono with dragonfly pattern and boots, he holds an old e-reader of 14 inches;
the [[Sandal Girl]] has wooden sandals, maybe modified to sound louder, and a well-made kimono whose quality looks higher than needed.

She said that [[Hannah]] isn't going to the mountain with them, and she doesn't want to go to the forest unlike last time.
His name is probably Toma
He said that if they get a fountain firework--, and she stops him from talking about this until we leave.
Talked about schoolwork; they are students of School. We saw three students the first time, and these are two of them.
Talked about the office hours, for which you must wake up early.

Mike told a story about a mischief from his childhood.
It seems he was confused as to why he's doing it. Yarik was very confused about why he was being told this.
This has not affected the children; now they discuss the festival, which is a day when their parents will prevent them from doing things they want in the evening.
