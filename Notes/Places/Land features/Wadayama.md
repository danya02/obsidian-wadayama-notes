alias: ["Wadayama Town"]
---

Part of the [[Kyoto]] Prefecture.

Has an intercity trolleybus going along the [[Main road]].
Has a single Supermarket and the School for both the locals and people from [[Nantan]].

North is [[Nantan]]. South is [[Kyoto]].
Contains the [[River Katsura]], which is in a valley formed by [[Mt Hakkai]].

The city has had very few things written about it until the 2030-2040s.
The city was known by the [[Inari]] festival, which was initially religious-related but isn't now.
There is the Camping site here, for cheap camping with a view towards Kyoto if you don't mind going here with the trolleybus.
