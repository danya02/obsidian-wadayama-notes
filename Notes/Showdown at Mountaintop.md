We received a call from [[Nobusuke]], where he told us that "those bastards are chasing me up the mountain". When we arrived, we saw him backing into a bush  away from the [[Spirit of Wadayama]], holding a sword and wearing a [[Fox masks]]. She does not turn her head and says "go away and forget what you saw here", while Nobuske says "I'm going to be killed, do something!".

Has [[Inoue Kyoko]]'s hairstyle and matching height. We say "why are you doing this, Kyoko?" and hear male voice response using old Japanese with speaker built into clothes, "the followers of the old ronin should save themselves lest they suffer the same fate".

[[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] begins to approach while saying "please think about what you're doing", but is ignored as Kyoko raises the sword to strike. 

[[Akito Edmunds]], [[Mike Bequith|Mike]] and [[Tadashi Hamada|Yarik]] battle [[Inoue Kyoko]] and the [[Spirit of Wadayama]], as she attacks [[Nobusuke]].

Turn 1: Enemy -> Yarik[Q] -> Mike[8] -> Dan[3] -> Nobuske
She hits him twice, drawing blood.
Yarik runs to her, trying to pull the cable out of her, but she dodges. The voice from the speaker said "stop, you don't know what you're doing"
Mike does the same, but also fails.
I try tackling her to the ground, but also fail.
Nobuske draws a gun and shoots her. Her clothes are bloodied, but she somehow stays up.
Turn 2: Enemy[A] -> Mike -> Yarik -> Nobuske -> Dan
She recovers and tries hitting Nobuske again, but misses.

She hits a very good attack and Nobuske is hit for 9, which makes him Shaken.
He tries to recover but fails.
Yarik and Dan repeat their attacks, but fail.
Mike tries pulling the cable and succeeds, ripping it out.
Kyoko slowly picks it up. She is full of resolve, though you cannot see it in her eyes.
The voice yells "what have you done, you have doomed her".
Turn 3: Nobuske -> Dan -> Enemy -> Yarik -> Mike
Nobuske's gun jams, and he yells "not now!"
I grab her successfully, making her Entangled.
She tries hitting him again, but cannot. She is now Vulnerable.
Yarik says "violence was never the answer", the voice responds "what do you know about justice".
Yarik tries knocking her out twice. It hits the mask, breaking it in half. Dan holds onto her knocked-out body.
The voice continues "you're going to kill an innocent person if you don't put the cable back in"
Nobuske succeeds in fixing his gun, but listens to Mike's advice not to shoot.

We plug the cable back in.
The voice says "get him, or the yakuza will shoot you".
Nobuske says "who are you going to believe, when I was nearly killed"

Voice says that Nobuske's real name is Kagutogawa Nichou, that he's a mafia leader who came here to terrorize the population.

Nobuske becomes even angrier, saying "I'm normal now, and if it weren't for you then this wouldn't have happened".

Yarik steps between, saying "if you've changed, then lower your weapon".

The voice quietly (so that Nobuske doesn't hear) says "slowly release her, or I'll fry her brain. Do not ask too many questions. Do not unplug her because the machine is faster"

"stop him and nobody gets hurt"

"You are his enemies but he doesn't show it"

We release Kyoko.
Nobuske starts retreating. "You have served me, but I think our paths diverge here. I won't give you money here, but forget this and let it be your payment".
Yarik rushes to him and tries hitting him with his stick.
He says "you lying bastard" and shoots him, killing him instantly.
With his dying breath, he says "you haven't changed after all"

It has no screen, a connection to a neurocalibrator, and a wiped drive.
